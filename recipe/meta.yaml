  summary: Convert data from Bruker to DICOM and from DICOM to NIfTI

  description: |
    Dicomifier is a set of tools to convert Bruker data to DICOM files, and 
    DICOM files to NIfTI. It retains meta-data (e.g. MR parameters such as echo 
    time or subject parameters such as weight or height) throughout the 
    conversion process, storing them in JSON format, allowing easy access in 
    multiple environments. The meta-data from Bruker is aligned on the DICOM 
    dictionary for unified human and animal processing pipelines.
